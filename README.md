# Introduction to MLOps

This project is intended to get myself familiar with the various MLOps tools, and develop an internal workflow of how to better structure machine learning projects. This is necessiated by the fact that I do not come from a software development background, so I'd want to tread lightly and build up my fundamentals first. 

## Topics that I intend to cover

* Introduction to MLOps
    * Environment Preparation
    * Data Science Cookie Cutter Toy Project
* Development Best Practices
    * Git and GitHub
    * Unit and Integration Testing
    * Pre-commit hooks and Makefile
    * CI/CD using GitHub Actions
